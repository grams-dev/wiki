# Environment Setup

To start developing on Grams, you need to set up your development environment. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to ensure you have all the tools and dependencies in place.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download the latest version from the official Node.js website ([https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)).

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Verify that Node.js is installed by running the following command:

   ```shell
   node --version
   ```

   You should see the version number of Node.js displayed in the terminal.

3. Install the Grams CLI (Command Line Interface) by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install -g @grams-dev/cli
   ```

   This will install the Grams CLI globally on your system, allowing you to interact with the Grams network and perform various development tasks.

4. Verify that the Grams CLI is installed correctly by running the following command:

   ```shell
   gex --version
   ```

   You should see the version number of the Grams CLI displayed in the terminal.

5. Congratulations! Your development environment is now set up and ready to use.

### Next Steps

Now that you have set up your development environment, you can proceed to the next steps, such as creating a new Grams project, deploying smart contracts, or interacting with the Grams network. Refer to the Grams documentation and developer guides for more information on getting started with Grams development.

Happy coding!
