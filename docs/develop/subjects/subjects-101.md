# Subjects 101

Welcome to Subjects, your intuitive approach to decentralized programming.

## 🧩 What are Subjects?

Subjects form the essence of subject-oriented programming. By grouping behavior, state, trigger, and subscription, they pave the way for powerful decentralized applications that champion both reusability and extensibility.

## 🧐 Why Subjects?

- **Modularity**: Subjects are like lego blocks — individual but seamlessly connectable.
- **Reusability**: One subject, multiple projects.
- **Interoperability**: They integrate smoothly with each other and various systems.
- **Extendability**: Upgrading a subject with new features is a breeze!

## 📊 Subjects vs. Established Paradigms

For a clearer perspective, let's juxtapose Subjects against Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and prevailing smart contract strategies:

| Features | OOP 📚 | Smart Contracts 🔒 | Subjects 🌟 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Focus | Objects with State & Behavior | Immutable contracts | Behavior, State, Trigger, Subscription |
| Coupling Nature | Can be intricate | Dependencies on other contracts | Autonomous by design |
| Architecture | Class-based | Function & state-centric | Built as interoperable units |
| Adaptability | Needs inheritance | Constrained by immutability | Flexible and welcoming to enhancements |
| Scalability Concerns | Complexities with deep hierarchies | Limited by chain specifics | Scalable by nature |
| Reusability Span | Via libraries | Contract-bound | Across varied projects |

This delineation showcases the operational superiority and flexibility Subjects bring to decentralized coding.

   gsx init
   ```

Choose your preferred path or mix and match as you explore the world of Subjects!

## 🎨 Anatomy of a Subject

Dissect a subject:

- **Behavior**: How the subject responds. 
- **State**: Current data or status.
- **Trigger**: What propels the subject to act.
- **Subscription**: Staying in the loop with particular events.

With these in your toolkit, you're geared to excel in subject-oriented programming.
