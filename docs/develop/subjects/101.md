# Subjects 101

Subjects form the backbone of decentralized programming in the Grams ecosystem. These entities encapsulate behavior, state, trigger, and subscription, offering a seamless blend of modularity and adaptability.

## Protocol Agnostic Design

Designed using an Interface Definition Language (IDL) or a JSON Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), Subjects are inherently protocol agnostic. This unique approach ensures:

- **Future-Proofing**: Their design is resilient to evolving technological landscapes.
  
- **Broad Compatibility**: They facilitate the generation of client-side packages and contracts. While Solidity is currently supported, there's a roadmap for incorporating WebAssembly in order to secure immediate support for IOTA's generalized smart contract platform.

## Anatomy of a Subject

- **Behavior**: Dictates the Subject's actions.
  
- **State**: Represents current data or status.
  
- **Triggers**: Events a Subject can initiate.
  
- **Subscriptions**: Mechanisms for a Subject to monitor specific events.

## Example of a `.subject` File

```
namespace subject.example

subject Organization {

   version: "2.1.0"

   state: [Team]

   behaviors: [JoinTeam]
}

state Team {
   members: TeamMembers
}

list TeamMembers {
   member: Address
}

behavior JoinTeam {
   input: string
}
```

## Building with Subjects

- **Desktop App**: For a visual approach, our application interface is available for [download](https://grams.dev/download/).

- **CLI**: For terminal enthusiasts:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @grams-dev/subjects
   gsx init mySubjectNamespace
   ```

Subjects are declared inside a namespace to provide an encapsulation for multiple subjects within a package.

## Comparing Paradigms

Juxtaposing Subjects against Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and prevailing smart contract strategies offers clarity:

| Features | OOP ðŸ“š | Smart Contracts ðŸ”’ | Subjects ðŸŒŸ |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Focus | Objects with State & Behavior | Immutable contracts | Behavior, State, Trigger, Subscription |
| Coupling Nature | Intricate | Dependencies on other contracts | Autonomous by design |
| Architecture | Class-based | Function & state-centric | Interoperable units |
| Adaptability | Requires inheritance | Constrained by immutability | Naturally flexible |
| Scalability Concerns | Hierarchical complexities | Chain-specific limitations | Inherently scalable |
| Reusability Span | Through libraries | Contract-specific | Across varied projects |
