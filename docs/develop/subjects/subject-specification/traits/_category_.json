        "description": "Diving into the Traits section, you'll discover the modular characteristics and behaviors that subjects within the Grams framework can adopt. Traits are like building blocks, allowing developers to mix and match functionalities as per their requirements. They define specific behaviors or characteristics that a subject can embody and are often mapped to corresponding Solidity constructs. This directory ensures that developers have a repository of reusable, standardized behaviors, streamlining the development process and ensuring best practices are adhered to."
