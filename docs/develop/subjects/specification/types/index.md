# Types

The Types section houses the fundamental data structures and data types integral to the Grams Subject Model. These types align with standard Ethereum and web3 conventions, ensuring seamless integration and interoperability. Inside, you'll find definitions that range from Ethereum addresses to large integers, encapsulating the diverse range of data structures needed for decentralized applications. By centralizing these type definitions, the Grams framework ensures consistency and clarity across all subjects.
