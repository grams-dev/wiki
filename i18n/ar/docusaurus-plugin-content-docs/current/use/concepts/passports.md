Passports are your digital identity credentials within the Grams ecosystem. They serve as your verified proof of identity and provide access to various services and features. In this guide, we will explore what passports are, how they work, and the benefits they offer.

## What is a Passport?

A **passport** is like your digital ID card in Grams. It is a secure and verifiable identity document that proves who you are in the Grams ecosystem. With your passport, you can access services, interact with others, and participate in activities on the platform.

## How Passports Work

Passports are created during the onboarding process, where you provide your personal information and undergo identity verification. This ensures that genuine individuals can be verified using a passport.

Once your passport is created and verified, it becomes associated with your Grams account. This association allows you to access various features and services that require identity verification or authentication.

Passports in Grams are based on a technology called **signed credentials**. These are cryptographic proofs that verify the authenticity and integrity of your identity information. They are securely stored and can be presented to others as proof of your verified identity.

## Presenting Your Passport

Just like presenting your physical ID card to prove your identity, you can present your digital passport in Grams. This is done through a process called **presentation**, where you share your signed credentials with others to establish trust and gain access to certain services or activities.

When you present your passport, you are essentially sharing a cryptographic proof of your identity without revealing your actual personal information. This ensures privacy while still establishing trust and enabling secure interactions within the Grams platform.

## Benefits of Passports

Using passports in Grams offers several benefits:

1. **Enhanced Security**: Passports provide an extra layer of security by verifying your identity and ensuring that only authorized individuals can access certain resources or perform specific actions.

2. **Trust and Credibility**: Having a verified passport establishes trust and credibility among users, reducing the risk of fraudulent activities and fostering a safer community.

3. **Streamlined User Experience**: Once your passport is verified, you can enjoy a seamless experience across various services and features within the Grams platform without the need for repeated identity verification.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the importance of passports and how they work in Grams, you can confidently navigate the platform and make use of the services that require passport verification. Look for features that require passport authentication, participate in secure activities, and interact with verified entities within the Grams ecosystem.

To learn more about setting up and managing your passport, refer to the documentation and resources provided by Grams. They will guide you through the process of creating, verifying, and effectively utilizing your passport.
