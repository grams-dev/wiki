Passport is a key component of the Grams ecosystem that allows users to store and manage their identity and personal information in a secure and decentralized way. Passport is built on top of the Grams blockchain and utilizes cryptography to ensure the authenticity and privacy of user data.

Passport is designed to be a simple and intuitive way for users to control their personal information and share it with trusted parties. Here are some of the core concepts behind Passport:

### Identity
In Passport, an identity is a collection of personal information that belongs to a specific user. Each identity is associated with a unique address on the blockchain and can be controlled by a private key.

### Document
Passport supports a wide range of personal information, such as name, address, date of birth, and contact information. Each piece of personal information is stored on the blockchain in an encrypted format to ensure privacy.

### Credentials
A credential is a verified claim made by an issuer about a user's personal information. Credentials can be used to verify a user's identity or other aspects of their personal information. For example, a credential from a university could verify a user's degree or enrollment status.

### Issuers
Issuers are entities that can issue credentials on the Grams blockchain. Issuers are trusted parties that can verify a user's personal information and create verifiable credentials for that information. Examples of issuers include universities, government agencies, and healthcare providers.

### Verifiers
Verifiers are entities that can verify the authenticity of a credential. Verifiers are typically third parties that need to verify a user's identity or personal information, such as employers or landlords.

### Mnemonic Phrase
A mnemonic phrase is a sequence of words used to generate a private key for an identity. In Passport, users can generate a mnemonic phrase to control their identity and personal information.
