In Grams, a **collectible** refers to a distinct digital asset that can be owned, transferred, and displayed. Collectibles can take various forms, such as digital art, virtual trading cards, in-game items, or unique digital representations of physical objects. What sets collectibles apart is their rarity, uniqueness, and the value attributed to them by the community.
